205 Fusion pairs was initially filtered out since one partner in these pairs doesn't have data from the IID database
Among the rest of 208 fusion pairs, I collect the number of each partner's protein interactors, 
    their protein domain information(from IID and fpclass), and input each pair to ChiTras database for transcript 
    and domain information. 
    127 in 208 have no known transcript/domain information from the ChiTaRs Database.
